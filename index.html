    <h1>3DS Modding Services</h1>
    <h3>Unlock the full potential of your Nintendo 3DS</h3>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Before you read, there's a few things you should know.
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>My service costs money.</b> Twenty dollars to be
            exact. Console modding takes time. As much as I'd like to do it for free, it's a too much work
            without an incentive.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b>Yes, I can mod your 2DS.</b> When I first started asking people if they were interested, many people
            thought they couldn't get the service because they didn't have a generic model 3DS. I can mod any model of
            3DS. <br><br>For those who don't know, the 3DS models are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>2DS</li>
                <li>3DS</li>
                <li>3DS XL</li>
                <li>New 3DS</li>
                <li>New 3DS XL</li>
                <li>New 2DS XL</li>
            </ul><br>
            I can also mod your DSi, but that's a bit of a special case. I'll talk about that more later on.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b>Depending on your model, certain things can be limited.</b> This mostly applies to emulation, but it can
            affect some other things. The "New" 3DS models have more powerful hardware, and are able to do certain
            things a regular 3DS can't. The biggest example of this is SNES and PS1 emulation. Regular 3DS models are
            not powerful enough to emulate these consoles, and it will be extremely laggy if you try to force them to.
        </li><br>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to start with these right off the bat just to make sure you know. The last thing I want is a confused
        or unaware customer. You can go and read the rest now. Cheers!
    </p>

    <h2 id="games">Games</h2>
    <p>
        As you may or may not know, the 3DS eShop is shutting down very soon (with heavy restrictions already being
        placed on purchases). This means most 3DS games will become impossible to obtain, not counting resale physical
        copies. With a modded 3DS however, this is no longer the case. <b>A modded 3DS can download and install any 3DS
        game or piece of software for free.</b> If it sounds too good to be true, don't worry. This is completely safe
        and will not get you in trouble with Nintendo in any way. If there's been a particular game you've been dying to
        play but haven't been able to find, then you're in luck.
    </p>

    <h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Emulation and Backwards Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
        A modded 3DS can run than just 3DS games. Thanks to extra hardware present, <b>a modded 3DS can run games from
        the DS and GBA</b> natively. Most people already know the 3DS can play DS cartridges, but a modded one can
        load them from the SD card and run them from the home menu. This is the case for all 3DS models. And that's not
        even with emulation. With emulation, <b>a modded 3DS can also run games from the GB, GBC, and NES as well as the
        SNES and PS1 on "New" 3DS consoles.</b> This means that, for example, you could run every single Pokémon game up
        to Generation 7 on the same 3DS (and transfer between all of them with Pokémon Bank). On my very own New 2DS XL,
        I have the entire original Crash Bandicoot trilogy, as well as both PaRappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
    <p>
        One of the best features of a modded 3DS (for me at least) is the customization. <b>A modded 3DS is able to use
        custom themes for the home menu, a splash screen on startup, and custom icons to organize folders.</b> Here's a
        screenshot from the home menu on my own 3DS, themed after Donkey Kong Country.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/customization.png" alt="cri">
    <p>
        You can see that it's pretty well organized, and it's easy to tell what every folder is for. It plays custom music
        as well! <b>I'm willing to make custom themes as a part of the service</b>, but it can take quite a while to make a
        good quality one (so don't expect me to make them at lightning fast speeds).
    </p>

    <h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>
    <p>
        There's a lot a modded 3DS can do; It would be impossible to explain everything here. So, here's a lightning round
        of handy things you can do with your modded 3DS.
        <ul>
            <li>Backup your game saves</li>
            <li>Play community created ports of games (Mario 64, DOOM, and the original FNAF games to name a few)</li>
            <li>Install games from cartridges</li>
            <li>Use game cheats (if that's how you roll)</li>
            <li>Take full quality screenshots</li>
            <li>Change your RTC clock to bypass time walls</li>
            <li>Play games from other regions</li>
            <li>Use screen filters for comfortable late-night play sessions</li>
            <li>Access the entire online Homebrew library (there is a lot)</li>
            <li>...and pretty much anything else!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="dsi">DSi</h2>
    <p>
        I can mod your DSi. However, it is significantly more limited. The DSi can only really play regular DS and GBA
        games, and not much beyond that. If you do want me to mod your DSi, I'll do it at half price, for 10 bucks.
